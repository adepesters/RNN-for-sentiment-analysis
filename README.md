In this project, I build and train a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Tensorflow to recognize between positive and negative movie reviews from IMDB. An accuracy of 84% is achieved.

This is an adaptation of a project carried out in the context of the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation by Udacity.
